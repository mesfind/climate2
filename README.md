# Python for analyzing and visualizing spatio-temporal data

These lessons will introduce you to Python for analyzing and visualizing spatio-temporal data. 
We are using datasets from the environmental sciences that are freely available.

These lessons have been developed at the University of Oslo by **Ana Costa Conrado**, **Gladys Nalvarte** and **Anne Fouilloux**.

Who: The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers. 

Prerequisites:

Learners need to understand what files and directories are and what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the [Unix Shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
Learners need to have some prior knowledge of Python. For instance, what is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) is sufficient.
Learners must install Python. See the [setup instructions](https://annefou.github.io/metos_python/setup/).
A few additional python libraries need to be installed before the class starts. See [here](https://annefou.github.io/metos_python/setup/) which packages and how to install them.
Learners must get the metos data before class starts: please download and unzip the file [metos-python-data.tar](https://zenodo.org/record/995709/files/metos-python-data.tar).
